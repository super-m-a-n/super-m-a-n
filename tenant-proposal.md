# TENANT PROPOSAL: VASILEIOS VASILAKIS
## WHO AM I
Many greetings! My name is Vasileios, but my acquaintances and close friends call me Bill :).
I am 23 years young, coming from Athens, Greece. I plan to move to Zurich in September to start
my Master's degree in Computer Science at ETH.
## EDUCATION & WORK EXPERIENCE
I hold a Bachelor's (BSc) degree in Computer Science from the University of Athens. My main interests 
revolve around algorithmic design, artificial intelligence and teaching, one of my passions. This past year I've
been employed as a software engineer in the industry, before returning to academia.
## HOBBIES
Regarding hobbies, one major enjoyment of mine are sports. I've been training calisthenics for the last 6 years, and
I also like to consider myself a pretty decent basketball player :). Lately boxing and mma have caught my interest and I
definitely plan to start getting more into that in the future.

Reading books is another activity I'm really keen on. Exploring the mind and the ideas of remarkable people intrigues me and helps
me improve as an individual.

Last but not least, above all I enjoy socializing. I love travelling and long deep meaningful conversations. Moving abroad is an ideal opportunity for me to 
meet new interesting people, exchange ideas, explore new perspectives and better myself as a result.


## BEHAVIOR AS A TENANT, FLATMATE AND ROOMATE
In terms of character, I would describe myself as easy-going, social, flexible and understanding.
Therefore, I believe I can co-exist smoothly with any type of flatmate, socializing with
extroverted ones and respecting the stricter boundaries of more introverted ones.
In terms of lifestyle during “house hours”, I don’t spend much time in my room – I prefer to
either socialize in the shared spaces, participate in the flat’s activities or go outside to do
sports, have a coffee or hang around in the campus. I also value proper hygiene. I wash my most
recently used clothes, bedsheets and towels weekly and I vacuum and mop my room and shared
spaces every weekend. I'm not a great chef (yet) so my cooking is really basic and I never leave
a mess in the kitchen (since I don't use many items). For the sake of completeness, I don't smoke
or vape, and I never consume alcohol alone. It goes without saying that I respect quiet hours
and the privacy of the other flatmates.
Fortunately, I lived 3 years by myself from 18 to 21 and I've been living with my brother ever
since, sharing a 2-room flat. I lived in a student house for 6 months during my exchange
semester in Lugano, sharing the kitchen with 5 other people. I also have brief experiences (less
than 2 weeks) in other forms of temporary residence, such as shared flats with shared WC &
kitchen, shared rooms, student dorms and camping.
I believe that I have extensive experience with various accommodation options, in addition to
living alone and sharing with other people, thus I am confident that I will quickly adapt to any
given setup.
## EXPECTATIONS FROM OTHER FLATMATES
My boundaries with respect to sharing an apartment, revolve around 2 baseline points:
1) respecting quiet hours (since I really value a good night's sleep) on a regular basis, and
2) preserving some basic hygiene level in shared spaces.
Of course, I am more than understanding if the 1st point can't be kept in special
occasions, such as birthdays or Saturdays, but this should not be the norm.
## PICTURES
The rest of this proposal contains various pictures in which I was fortunate enough to be
included. Some of them were taken during my exchange semester in Lugano, whereas other
refer to excursions or events with friends.
During the BSc graduation ceremony. As
the class Valedictorian, I read the oath.
With my friends after the ceremony. They even made a celebration banner...
 At a tennis tournament. Chess is also a nice hobby I'm not particularly
good at.
At the car museum in Torino, a bit
expensive hobby.
Indian dinner in Lugano. Hawaiian party, oddly enough not in Hawaii. Just a typical party in Lugano.
Conquering Mt. San Salvatore.
Fun times cooking in the student dorm. At a birthday party in Lugano.
With my best friends in Lugano.
With my best friends in Zurich. With my best friends in Amsterdam.
